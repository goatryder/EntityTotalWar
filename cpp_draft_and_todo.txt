// create or find navigationsybsystem

// todo with style and ideology of mass entity framework: 
1. pass location projected from cursor to state tree
2. create task to retrive path and save (upgrade to async path request)
3. create task to move by pass

4.0 hit detection (try async or parallel processing)

4. health  killing (destroying)

*4.1 maybe colliding with landscape

5. do damage with linetrace (deffered call probably or async)

**5.1 do damage with projectile (projectile entity) (dynamic spawn and destroying deffered)


6. squad relation
7. squad movement (try single point with offsets)
8. squad reformat
 
 9. REPLICATION


!!! Mass Nav Movement Subsystem -> replicate few points to fragment
!!! Mass Nav Movement Subsystem -> Find path async -> signal processor

!!! Maybe do the same with Surface Movement



______________________________________________________________________________

REPLICATION


replicate box creation, delete, alter (change color for example)
try actor movement rep



______________________________________________________
movement ecs
make with movement component and ecs, make without ecs, fully ecs and movement THEN compare it!
replicate
squad mechanics
animations 


2k vs 2k fight



______________________________________________________
end work:
massive fight for 2 players 2k vs 2k
squad formations melee projectile trace machines
vertex deformation terain and destruction
deffense buildings
ships?)

or simcity clone

use modularity game feature plugin, advanced input just like in lyra
